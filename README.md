# OOP_tamplates

The project is a program developed using the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and design patterns. The project is designed for managing cars, their owners, and various types of repair work. The project is developed in C++ using the Qt library. It applies design patterns such as "Factory" and "Facade" and adheres to the principles of object-oriented programming to improve code structure and readability. Signals and slots are actively used for interaction between objects.

The project uses the following OOP classes and templates:

Abstract - an abstract class used as the base for classes representing various types of repair work (classes Body, Cosmetic, Engine, Overhaul, Painting).

Cars - a class that holds information about cars.

Owners - a class that contains data about car owners.

Registration - a class used for tracking repair work and their statuses.

Facade and Factory - classes and templates responsible for calculating the cost of repair work.

Lists - a class for managing lists of cars, owners, and repair work.
